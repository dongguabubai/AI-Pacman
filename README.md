# AI-Pacman
The project was developed based a classical video game, Pac-man. I apply array of AI techniques to playing Pac-man. I achieve several fundamental AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, reinforcement learning and Bayes network. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
